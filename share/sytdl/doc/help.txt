Usage:
    sytdl [-Dhvx] [-d destination] [-f filename] [-s source]

This is a program for making the argument syntax of yt-dlp a little simpler.
It provides four commonplaces uses of yt-dlp for the user.

Mandatory arguments:
    -s <source>         the URL source of the video to download

Optional arguments (with values):
    -d <destination>    location to save the downloaded file; if not given,
                        the present working directory will be used
    -f <filename>       name for the downloaded file; if not given, the title
                        of the source video will be used

Optional arguments (without values):
    -D                  enable debug logging
    -h                  display this help and exit
    -v                  display version number and exit
    -x                  extract and save audio from source, discarding video

sytdl relies on yt-dlp. If yt-dlp is not present in any folder defined by
the $PATH variable, sytdl will not run.
