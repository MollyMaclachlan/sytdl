# Short YouTube Downloader (SYTDL)

**SYTDL**, an acronym for **Short YouTube Downloader**, is a program for making the argument syntax of youtube-dlp a little shorter. It provides four commonplace uses of youtube-dlp for the user.

Currently the only option is using youtube-dlp, but I intend to add cases for more options and a command to switch between using youtube-dl, youtube-dlc, and youtube-dlp.
