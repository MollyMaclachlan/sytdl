==============================SYTDL===============================

This is a program for making the argument syntax of youtube-dl a
little shorter. It provides four commonplace uses of youtube-dl
for the user:
- downloading a video, using the title of said video as the file-
  name,
- downloading a video with a custom filename,
- extracting audio from a video, using the title of said video as
  the filename,
- extracting audio with a custom filename.

The basic format of a command looks like this:

    sytdl [video url] [output path]

SYTDL will automatically navigate to your home folder, so your out-
put path should account for this. Additionally, do not include
surrounding slashes; only ones between directories. For example:

    INCORRECT: sytdl [video url] /home/user/music/youtube/
    CORRECT:   sytdl [video url] music/youtube

There are three optional arguments available for SYTDL. They are:

    -c: allows the user to enter a custom filename
    -d: activates debug mode; will print the youtube-dl command
        to be executed
    -x: extract the audio from the video, deleting the original
        video file upon completion

These optional arguments may be applied after the mandatory argu-
ments, in any order, as in the following format:

    sytdl [video url] [output path] [optional arguments]
    
If you invoke "-c", your output path must include the filename,
but not the file extension.
